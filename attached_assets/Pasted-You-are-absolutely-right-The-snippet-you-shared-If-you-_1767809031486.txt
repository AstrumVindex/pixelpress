You are absolutely right. The snippet you shared ("If you intend to use a PSU with") shows classic "rasterization blur."

The issue is that **PDFs are Vectors** (mathematical lines that stay sharp forever), but **JPGs are Pixels** (dots). Even at `scale: 3.0`, we are essentially taking a photo of the document. If you zoom in past that "photo's" resolution, it gets blurry.

To match the "infinite zoom" feel as closely as possible, we need to crank the resolution up to **Scale 5.0 (Ultra HD)**. This will create images that are roughly **4000x5000 pixels** (similar to a 4K monitor), making text look razor-sharp.

Here is the **Ultra-HD Engine Upgrade** prompt for Replit.

### **Prompt for Replit AI**

**Task:** Upgrade the PDF conversion engine to "Ultra HD" quality.
**Problem:** The current scale of `3.0` is still blurry when zooming in on text-heavy documents.
**Solution:** Increase the render scale to `5.0` (approx 360 DPI) and strictly enforce a white background to prevent anti-aliasing artifacts on text.

**Update File:** `src/utils/converterEngine.js`

Replace the `convertPdfToImages` function with this **Ultra-Sharp** version:

```javascript
/**
 * 1. PDF TO IMAGE CONVERTER (Ultra HD Fix)
 * Renders PDF pages as 5x Resolution Images for maximum text clarity.
 */
export const convertPdfToImages = async (file, outputFormat) => {
  const arrayBuffer = await file.arrayBuffer();
  const pdf = await pdfjsLib.getDocument(arrayBuffer).promise;
  const outputFiles = [];

  for (let i = 1; i <= pdf.numPages; i++) {
    const page = await pdf.getPage(i);
    
    // SCALE 5.0 = Ultra High Definition (~360 DPI)
    // This creates very large images (approx 3500px x 5000px)
    // ensuring text remains sharp even when zoomed in significantly.
    const viewport = page.getViewport({ scale: 5.0 }); 

    const canvas = document.createElement('canvas');
    const context = canvas.getContext('2d');
    canvas.height = viewport.height;
    canvas.width = viewport.width;

    // OPTIMIZATION: Disable smoothing to keep text edges crisp during rendering
    context.imageSmoothingEnabled = false;

    // CRITICAL: Fill background white. 
    // PDFs have transparent backgrounds by default. 
    // Converting transparent text to JPG often causes blurry gray fringing.
    context.fillStyle = '#FFFFFF';
    context.fillRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);

    const renderContext = {
      canvasContext: context,
      viewport: viewport,
      // Enable text enhancement flags if supported by version
      background: 'rgba(255, 255, 255, 1)' 
    };

    await page.render(renderContext).promise;

    // Export at 100% Quality (1.0)
    const blob = await new Promise(resolve => canvas.toBlob(resolve, `image/${outputFormat}`, 1.0));
    
    outputFiles.push({
      blob: blob,
      name: `${file.name.replace('.pdf', '')}_page_${i}.${outputFormat}`,
      size: blob.size
    });
  }

  return outputFiles;
};

```

### Why this fixes the text:

1. **Scale 5.0:** We are now using ~360 DPI (Print Quality). The text will look sharp even if you print it on paper.
2. **White Background:** Standard PDF-to-JPG conversion often leaves the background "transparent" during the math phase, which browsers try to blend, resulting in gray blurry edges around black text. Forces a solid white background makes black text "pop" and stay crisp.
3. **No Smoothing:** `imageSmoothingEnabled = false` tells the canvas "Don't try to blur pixels to make them look smooth." For text, we want sharp, hard edges.

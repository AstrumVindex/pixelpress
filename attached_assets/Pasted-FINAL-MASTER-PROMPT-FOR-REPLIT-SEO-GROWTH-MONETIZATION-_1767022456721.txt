FINAL MASTER PROMPT FOR REPLIT (SEO + GROWTH + MONETIZATION)

You are improving an existing browser-based image compression website (PixelPress).
The goal is to transform it from a single-page tool into a search-optimized, scalable product that can rank on Google, attract organic traffic, and monetize non-intrusively.

This is NOT a cosmetic change. Implement proper structure.

🧱 PART 1: SITE ARCHITECTURE (CRITICAL)
Convert SPA → Multi-Page SEO Architecture

Create dedicated, crawlable pages with unique URLs and content:

/compress-png

/compress-jpeg

/compress-webp

/resize-image-for-passport

Each page must:

Be indexable

Have unique <title> and <meta description>

Use the SAME compression engine internally

Have visible text content (not hidden)

🧠 PART 2: ON-PAGE SEO (MANDATORY FOR EVERY PAGE)
1️⃣ <head> must be COMPLETE

Each page must include:

<title>Compress PNG Images Online – Free & Secure | PixelPress</title>

<meta name="description" content="Compress PNG images online without losing quality. Fast, secure, browser-based PNG compressor. No uploads required.">

<link rel="canonical" href="https://pixelpress.com/compress-png">

<meta name="robots" content="index, follow">
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">


Titles: 50–60 chars

Descriptions: 150–160 chars

NO duplicate titles across pages

2️⃣ Proper Heading Structure

Each page must follow:

<h1> → <h2> → <h3>


Example for /compress-png:

H1: Compress PNG Images Without Losing Quality

H2: Why PNG Compression Matters

H2: How PixelPress Compresses PNG Files

H2: Common Use Cases

🧩 PART 3: CONTENT STRATEGY (TEXT THAT RANKS)
Add contextual content blocks on each landing page

Example sections:

What is PNG/JPEG/WebP compression?

When to use this format

Why browser-based compression is safer

Who should use this (developers, bloggers, ecommerce)

Create a /blog section with articles:

“Why uploading images to servers is a privacy risk”

“How to optimize images for React & Next.js”

“WebAssembly vs server-side image compression”

“Best image size for websites in 2025”

Each blog post:

800–1200 words

Internal links to tool pages

No keyword stuffing

🧠 PART 4: SCHEMA MARKUP (VERY IMPORTANT)

Add SoftwareApplication schema to homepage and tool pages:

{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "SoftwareApplication",
  "name": "PixelPress",
  "applicationCategory": "MultimediaApplication",
  "operatingSystem": "Web",
  "offers": {
    "@type": "Offer",
    "price": "0",
    "priceCurrency": "USD"
  }
}


This helps Google show:

Rich snippets

App info

Higher CTR

⚡ PART 5: PERFORMANCE (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Target Lighthouse:

Performance: 100

SEO: 90+

Accessibility: 90+

Best Practices: 100

Requirements:

LCP image preloaded

No lazy-load on hero image

All JS deferred

Critical CSS inlined

No layout shifts

Comparison slider uses overlay masking, not resizing

🚀 PART 6: VIRAL & TRAFFIC MECHANISMS
Add subtle growth features:

“Images compressed today: XXXX” counter

Before/After comparison slider (already exists – keep it perfect)

After compression success:

Show “Saved 60% (2.1MB)”

Add small “Share your savings” button with prefilled text

Add footer badges:

“100% Browser-Based”

“No Server Uploads”

“Privacy First”

💰 PART 7: FUTURE MONETIZATION (DO NOT ENABLE ADS YET)

Prepare structure for:

Carbon Ads (dev-friendly)

Affiliate recommendations (hosting, design tools)

Freemium plan:

Free: 1 image

Pro: bulk, rename, AVIF/WebP batch

Donation link (“Buy me a coffee”)

Do NOT:

Add intrusive ads

Add popups

Gate core functionality yet

📁 PART 8: SEO INFRA FILES (MUST EXIST)

/robots.txt

/sitemap.xml (include all pages + blog)

Custom 404 page

HTTPS canonical enforcement

🎯 FINAL GOAL

This website must:

Rank for long-tail keywords

Be AdSense-ready

Be privacy-trustworthy

Feel premium, fast, and honest

Scale from a tool → product

Do not stop until structure is complete.

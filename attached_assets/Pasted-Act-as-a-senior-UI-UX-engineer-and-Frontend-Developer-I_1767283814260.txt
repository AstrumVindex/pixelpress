Act as a senior UI/UX engineer and Frontend Developer. I need to polish the design of my image compression website, PixelPress, to fix spacing issues, improve visual hierarchy, and make the content more scannable.

Please implement the following 5 specific changes to my code:

1. FIX THE "WHITE VOID" (SECTION STYLING)
Currently, the "Why Compress PNG Images?" text section floats in a large white space.
- Locate the content section immediately following the Hero/Upload section.
- Wrap this entire text section in a container with a light gray background (e.g., bg-gray-50 or #f9fafb) to visually separate it from the white Hero section.
- Add generous vertical padding (py-16 or py-20) to this new gray section to make it look professional.

2. IMPROVE SCANNABILITY (ICONS VS BULLETS)
In the "PNG Compression Benefits" section, replace the standard bulleted list (<ul>) with a 2x2 Grid layout.
- Instead of simple dots, use relevant icons for each point (e.g., a Rocket for "Faster speed", a Chart/Graph for "Lower bandwidth", a Search Glass for "SEO").
- If I am using a library like Lucide-React or Heroicons, use those. If not, use standard emojis or SVG placeholders for now.
- Style these items as small "cards" or flex-row items to make them readable at a glance.

3. OPTIMIZE THE HERO SECTION
The main headline "Compress PNG Images..." is pushing the Upload box too far down.
- Reduce the top margin/padding of the Hero section by about 20-30%.
- Ensure the "Upload an Image" box is fully visible "above the fold" on standard laptop screens without scrolling.
- Increase the size and visual weight of the main "Select Image" button. Give it a subtle shadow (shadow-lg) and slightly more padding to make it the clear primary action.

4. ADD A SECONDARY CALL-TO-ACTION (CTA)
Users hit a "dead end" at the bottom of the text content.
- Add a secondary button at the very bottom of the "Why Compress..." text section.
- Label it "Compress Your Images Now".
- Make it scroll the user smoothly back up to the main Upload area when clicked.

5. UNIFY FOOTER BADGES
In the Footer/Trust Badge section (where it says "100% Browser-Based", "No Server Uploads", etc.):
- Change the text/icon colors to be uniform. Currently, they are green, blue, and pink.
- Make them all use the primary brand color (Purple) or a neutral dark gray to look cleaner and more consistent.

Please analyze my current code structure (likely in App.jsx, index.css, or Home.jsx) and apply these changes now.

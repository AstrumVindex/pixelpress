Goal: Improve Google Lighthouse Mobile Performance score from ~64 to 90+ without breaking design or functionality.

Current issues observed (Mobile):

First Contentful Paint ≈ 5.9s (too slow)

Largest Contentful Paint ≈ 5.9s (too slow)

Desktop performance already good (≈95), do not regress desktop

No blocking JS issues (TBT = 0), CLS = 0 (good)

Tasks to implement (IMPORTANT):

1️⃣ Fix slow First & Largest Contentful Paint (PRIORITY)

Identify the LCP element (likely hero heading, main image, or upload card)

Ensure LCP element:

Loads immediately

Is NOT delayed by JS

Is NOT inside lazy-loaded components

2️⃣ Image Optimization (CRITICAL)

Convert all UI images to WebP

Add width and height attributes to all images

Use:

<img loading="lazy" decoding="async">


for all non-hero images

For hero/LCP image:

Disable lazy loading

Preload it:

<link rel="preload" as="image" href="hero.webp">

3️⃣ Reduce Mobile CSS Cost

Remove unused CSS

Split critical CSS:

Inline only above-the-fold CSS

Load rest asynchronously

Avoid large gradients/shadows on mobile

4️⃣ Defer & Optimize JavaScript

Add defer to ALL non-critical scripts

Move JS to bottom of body

Ensure no JS blocks initial render

Avoid running JS on page load unless required

5️⃣ Font Optimization (Very Important)

Use only 1 font family

Limit to 2 font weights max

Add:

<link rel="preload" as="font" type="font/woff2" crossorigin>


Use:

font-display: swap;

6️⃣ Mobile-Specific Improvements

Reduce padding/margins on mobile

Avoid heavy animations on load

Use media queries to simplify mobile layout

7️⃣ Server & Delivery

Enable GZIP or Brotli compression

Add proper cache headers for static assets

Ensure images, CSS, JS are cached

8️⃣ SEO & Best Practices (Keep 100 score)

Do NOT remove meta tags

Keep semantic HTML

Maintain accessibility score (83+)

Final requirement:

Mobile Performance ≥ 90

Desktop Performance ≥ 90

No layout shift

No visual quality loss

Keep UI clean and professional

After changes, re-test using Google PageSpeed Insights (Mobile first).

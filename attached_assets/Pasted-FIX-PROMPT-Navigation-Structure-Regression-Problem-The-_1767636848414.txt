FIX PROMPT — Navigation Structure Regression
Problem

The current navigation was modified incorrectly:

The “Compress Image” dropdown was removed

“Format Converter” appears twice in the navigation

This breaks usability, clarity, and SEO structure

The navigation must clearly separate compression tools and format conversion tools.

✅ Required Navigation Structure

The top navigation must contain two distinct dropdown menus, each with its own purpose:

1️⃣ Compress Image (Dropdown)

This menu is for image compression use cases, not format conversion.

Label: Compress Image

Dropdown items (example):

Compress PNG

Compress JPEG

Compress WebP

Compress JPG

Compress Image (All formats / main page)

Behavior rules:

These pages focus on reducing file size

User can upload only supported image formats

Output format may remain same or optimized (PNG → optimized PNG / WebP)

These pages are SEO landing pages (important)

2️⃣ Format Converter (Dropdown)

This menu is only for converting file formats, not compression-first workflows.

Label: Format Converter

Dropdown items (example):

PNG → JPG

JPG → PNG

JPG → WebP

WebP → PNG

Image Format Converter (All)

Behavior rules:

Primary goal = change format

Compression is optional or secondary

These pages target conversion keywords, not compression keywords

3️⃣ Correct Final Navigation Example
[ Compress Image ▼ ]   [ Format Converter ▼ ]   [ FAQ ]   [ Contact ]


❌ Do NOT duplicate menu names
❌ Do NOT merge compression & conversion into one dropdown
❌ Do NOT remove compression-specific navigation

4️⃣ SEO & UX Reason (Important)

“Compress PNG”, “Compress JPEG” are high-intent search keywords

“PNG to JPG” is a different user intent

Mixing them hurts:

SEO rankings

User trust

Navigation clarity

Each dropdown must reflect user intent clearly.

5️⃣ Implementation Notes

Restore the Compress Image dropdown

Remove the duplicated Format Converter

Ensure links route to the correct existing pages

Keep navigation responsive (desktop + mobile)

Do not change page logic, only navigation structure

✅ Acceptance Criteria

Navigation shows exactly one Compress Image menu

Navigation shows exactly one Format Converter menu

Each dropdown has correct, relevant items

No duplicate menu labels

Clear separation of compression vs conversion
